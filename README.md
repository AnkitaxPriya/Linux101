## Purpose of this repository 

This repo consists of basic Linux lessons and commands I learned by myself. 

## Introduction 
- Linux is a community of open-source Unix like operating systems that are based on the Linux Kernel.
- It is a free and open-source operating system and the source code can be modified and distributed to anyone commercially or non commercially under the GNU General Public License.
- Linux is generally packaged in a Linux distribution.

## Linux Distributions 
Linux distribution is an operating system that is made up of a collection of software based on Linux kernel or you can say distribution contains the Linux kernel and supporting libraries and software. DISTRO is a special term used for various Linux distributions with different flavours. Few types of DISTRO's are:
- Major Distro: Arc, Debian, Redhat, Slackware.
- Debian Distro: Mint, Ubuntu, Kali.
- Redhat Distro: CentOS, Fedora.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)
The Command Line Interface (CLI), is a non-graphical, text-based interface to the computer system, where the user types in a command and the computer then successfully executes it. The Terminal is the platform or the IDE that provides the command-line interface (CLI) environment to the user. It accepts a command and if the output is produced by the specific command, then this text is displayed in the terminal. If any of the problems with the commands are found, then some error message is displayed.

## General Command Syntax 
- Command: The command refers to the program run by the user.
- Option(s): The option tell the command how to operate. It always starts with "-" character and has a single letter.
- Argument: The arguments tell the command what to operate on.
